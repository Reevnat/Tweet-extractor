# Tweet-extractor
Here you will find the code that I used to extract the required tweets from twitter for my final year project. 
The aim of the project was to see if whether during an important upcoming event such as the 2015 UK General Election can social media (specifically Twitter) represent a way to understand certain behaviour and direction people take in regards to politics and a new way to provide results in the context of the UK General Election.
My program uses the Twitter Streaming API and the Track and Follow request parameters.
